          <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="main" -->
          <p>Airspeed High Ultralights started in July 2009 with  the intention of bringing a professional approach to Ultralight training.  Its owner/operator, Mr. Andreas Ruttkiewicz, is  a former Canadian Forces pilot, holds a private pilot licence and an Ultralight  permit with instructor rating.<br />
            He has flown an array of aircraft including CF-18s.  Andreas is a Transport Canada authorized  agent (to issue student pilot permits) and an Industry Canada Radio License  Examiner (to issue radio licenses).</p>
          <p>Airspeed High Ultralights believes that flight  training is fun and rewarding.  This  company’s philosophy is that one learns faster and better when taught in a  concentrated mode.  The ideal way to  train is for both student and instructor to dedicate themselves fully to the  task at hand.  It also happens to be the  most economical and quickest way for any student to learn to fly.</p>
          <p><strong>TRAINING  COSTS</strong></p>
          <p>Training costs are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Flight  theory course (approx. 30 hours):               $350.00</li>
            <li> Instructor,  per hour (engine time):                         $60.00</li>
            <li> Instructor  and aeroplane, per hour (engine time):   $160.00</li>
          </ul>
<p>	Prices quoted above include fuel, oil and all  applicable taxes. </p>
<p>Download a chart with a realistic breakdown of training costs. <a href="faq_training_costs.pdf">Training_cost.pdf</a></p>
<p>Payment method is “pay-as-you-go”.  You normally receive an invoice after two or  three flights and you pay your invoice by cash or cheque.  We do not have any facility to process credit  cards.</p>
